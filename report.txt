You must include a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.

The analysis is to observe the area-wide standardised test scores to understand where the resources shoul be spent. 
Wihtin this analysis is data from Englush and Maths results, average size of the schools, budgets and spending and which LGA they are in. 
1) Independent Schools made up 3 of the top 5 schools by overall passing rate and Government dominated the bottom 5.
2) Larger school size and larger school spending doesn't translate to greater pass rates. The lower spending ranges (per student: $585-$630) and size (1000-2000, <1000) yield the best results.
